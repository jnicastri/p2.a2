MAIN METHOD:
 * Main method is located in Launcher.java class - which is located in the lms.app package
 
ICONS:

ASSUMPTIONS MADE:
 * For Section 'iv) Display a grid-based view of a library collection showing all the existing holdings' on the assignment spec sheet - it says that "The library collection grid can have up to 4 columns and unlimited number of rows".
 It also says "each grid cell is sized to take up the maximum amount of available screen area". 
 
 I have followed the above requirements, however my grid will display differently than the sample shown on the assignment spec sheet in Fig.2. In the event of there being 5 holdings, my solution will display 3 used cells in the top row &
 2 used cells in the bottom row (as opposed to 4 used in the top row & just one used in the bottom) which conforms to the "sized to take up the maximum amount of available screen area" requirement.
